# Hash a Valheim world's save folder the way cli_world does, to prove which
# saved state a game loaded (its `files=` field and the `worldfiles` key).
#
#   world-hash.sh WORLD              hash VALHEIM_SAVES/WORLD
#   world-hash.sh /path/to/folder    hash that folder
#   world-hash.sh WORLD --compare    also ask the running game (cli_world) and
#                                    exit 1 when the two differ
#
# Recipe (docs/expectations.md): for every file under the folder, the line
# "relative/path:md5"; lines sorted in byte order, joined by \n with no
# trailing newline; the md5 of that text. Uses md5sum (Linux) or md5 (macOS).
#
# Use it on a copy you restore before each run: hash the copy, then compare
# with the game after it loads. The game hashes the folder just before it
# loads the world, so any later save does not change its answer; this script
# hashes the folder as it is now.
#
# Environment:
#   VALHEIM_SAVES     the worlds_local folder (default: the Steam save folder,
#                     ~/Library/Application Support/IronGate/Valheim/worlds_local
#                     on macOS, ~/.config/unity3d/IronGate/Valheim/worlds_local
#                     on Linux; a dedicated server started with -savedir keeps
#                     its worlds under that folder instead)
#   VALHEIM_CLI       path to the valheim-cli executable (default: valheim-cli on PATH)
#   VALHEIM_CLI_PORT  the game's CLI port (default 5555), for --compare
#
# --compare needs the game running as the server or host (a client has no
# world files). For a game on another machine, forward its port first:
# ssh -N -L 5555:127.0.0.1:5555 host
