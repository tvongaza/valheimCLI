# Valheim testing toolkit preview

Assistant-written implementation notes. Local prototype; the new adapter and automated scenarios still require their bounded Valheim checks.

## Test pyramid

1. **Broad base: unit and synthetic tests.** Real mod code runs against small explicit doubles and reusable terrain inputs. Fast default CI, no Valheim installation. Test decisions, persistence formats, queues, ownership and failures here.
2. **Smaller integration layer.** Exercise the CLI protocol/runner, adapter registry, fixture handling and scenario orchestration together with controlled transports. No game required for most of these.
3. **Small system-test cap.** Real dedicated server for save/restart and bridge respawn; one instrumented client for terrain replication/collision; one actual ScriptEngine reload to verify assembly binding. Prepared worlds, a few zones, bounded commands. Record unexecuted cases as pending.
4. **Human judgement.** A short look/walk where appearance or usability matters. Do not turn every visual issue into an exact-coordinate assertion.

A successful fake transport run is an orchestration test, not an in-game pass. An input replay round-trip proves capture plumbing, not the game's terrain implementation. Broader fake physics or copied routing algorithms would weaken this pyramid.

## Components

| Component | Runtime and purpose |
|---|---|
| `valheimCLI.dll` | net48, stable BepInEx plugin: existing commands, transport, broker, extension host |
| `Valheim.Cli.Testing` | net9, the same client and YAML runner used by the executable; source lives in `CLI/Testing` and compiles once for the executable |
| `Valheim.Testing` | netstandard2.0, synthetic plane/island/ridge/river and exact captured-sample replay; works with net48/Mono and modern .NET |
| `Valheim.Testing.Game` | net9, named actors, typed observations, bounded observation waits, fixture copies, comparisons and JSON/JUnit reports |
| Roads pilot | Separate Roads checkout: test-only world adapter, game observation plugin and system scenarios |

The toolkit currently incubates in this branch to keep changes testable together. Its engine-free projects can move to the dedicated toolkit repository before first publication; package boundaries are already separate. The upstream CLI PR should include the client-library split and extension API, not demand ownership of Roads tests. No Unity/game DLL is a toolkit dependency. In-game adapters must not load the net9 test-side packages.

## Run locally

```sh
dotnet test Tests/RequestBroker.Tests/RequestBroker.Tests.csproj
dotnet test Toolkit/Valheim.Testing.Tests/Valheim.Testing.Tests.csproj
dotnet build CLI/valheim-cli.csproj -c Release
# The next two require YOUR game/BepInEx assembly references in Environment.props:
dotnet build valheimCLI.csproj -c Release
dotnet build examples/ReloadProbe/ReloadProbe.csproj
```

The Roads pilot checkout has its own existing net10.0/net48 suite, the four extracted-fixture parity tests, and a separate `ProceduralRoads.SystemTests.Tests` suite. Existing test fixtures retain exact synthetic outputs; this requirement is about changing the input model, not demanding identical real-game road shapes.

## Extension API v1

Keep the core in normal `BepInEx/plugins`. Put only the optional test adapter in `BepInEx/scripts` for ScriptEngine reload. Do not load a second CLI/API assembly with the adapter. Core hot replacement during adapter work is not supported: finish work and restart the process. Assembly unload/managed-memory reclamation is not promised.

```csharp
registration = valheimCLIPlugin.Instance.Extensions.Register("my.mod.tests", "0.1.0", 1,
    new ExtensionCommand("snapshot", "Read a complete observation", Snapshot,
        readOnly: true, role: ExtensionRole.Server, needsWorld: true));
// OnDestroy: registration?.Dispose();
```

Registration validates every command before publishing any. Names are namespaced by owner. Each instance has a new token. Dispose removes capabilities immediately and cancels queued/active handlers. Cleanup runs in reverse order after work settles; cleanup failure prevents silent replacement. Handlers run on the main thread, yield `null` to wait a frame, and must return `context.Succeed(data)` or `context.Fail(code, message)`. Arbitrary Unity yield instructions are not supported in v1.

Mutation is the safe default (`readOnly: false`), requires devcommands, and uses the existing async operation gate. Joined-client mutation also requires the existing opt-in client setting. Trusted adapters can of course mislabel or ignore these rules; this is an API contract, not a sandbox. Tests must serialize other synchronous console mutations themselves.

If an effect continues after cancellation, install a `WaitForQuiescence` probe *before* issuing it. The core holds the gate and retiring owner until the probe confirms completion. A throwing/stuck probe leaves the owner blocked rather than claiming successful cleanup; diagnose and restart. The API cannot roll back arbitrary terrain/spawn/save effects.

Use `cli_extensions` to discover commands, instance tokens and result versions. Use `cli_extension owner/command args` over the normal CLI connection. JSON values are bounded to 256 KiB/16 levels, strings/finite numbers/bools/arrays/string-keyed objects. Unsupported values fail explicitly. The actor rejects stale instance tokens and incomplete measurements. Arguments are single tokens in this preview; adapters validate their own grammar.

The bundled `valheim.world/terrain x z generator|loaded-ground` observation demonstrates reuse. It distinguishes raw generator height from actual loaded heightmap ground. Missing heightmap returns `complete: false` and null height; it does not invent a zero.

## Actors, fixtures and evidence

A `GameActor` wraps the existing transport; it never owns/stops the attached process. Verify `cli_expect` pins before using an actor. Require a capability/version, issue a mutation once, then poll its read-only observation. Unknown outcomes are failures, not permission to resend. Keep the command timeout below the overall scenario allowance: a synchronous read cannot be forcibly interrupted by an observation deadline.

`WorldFixture.Copy` requires a hash manifest, refuses links and unexpected files, verifies copied bytes and creates its own new directory. It deletes only that copy; `Preserve=true` keeps it for debugging. Stop the owned game BEFORE disposing its world fixture. It does not own accounts, characters, ports or remote station locks. Those remain explicit session-operator responsibilities in preview 1.

`ScenarioReport` records outcomes and teardown failure in JSON/JUnit. Use a unique output directory per run; include fixture/build/config hashes in `Provenance`. Output may contain player/world data; inspect before publishing. Do not include credentials in fixture configuration or logs.

## Small game validation gate

- Reload probe A→B under ScriptEngine (**passed on Mac Valheim at the main menu, 26 September 2026; see [the repeatable check](../examples/ReloadCheck/README.md)**), with CLI core stable: change/remove a command, verify discovery and instance changed, retained command answers B, removed command is absent, connection remains usable.
- Roads empty-save scenario on a disposable old-network fixture: confirmed save, owned restart, zero cells/points/crossings, loaded-from-save true.
- Roads pending bridge append→respawn: prove pending before action; compare frozen independent expected pieces with marked ZDOs by full transform and multiplicity; save/restart and compare again.
- One matched-input replay/game boundary-road case and one Roads-absent instrumented-client observation: actual height, area readiness and collision. Preserve unknown/missing observations as incomplete. Use ordinary vanilla terrain for server-only acceptance.

Do not expand this into a full-world matrix per commit. These checks gate the preview release and relevant engine/adapter changes, not every local test iteration.
